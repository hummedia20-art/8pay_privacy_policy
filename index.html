      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <div class="meta">
        App Name: <strong>8th Pay Calculator</strong><br>
        Last updated: <strong>08 December 2025</strong>
      </div>

      <div class="highlight">
        This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>8th Pay Calculator</strong> app handles your information.
        By using the app, you agree to the practices described here.
      </div>

      <h2>1. About the App</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>8th Pay Calculator</strong> is a utility app that helps users calculate salary as per
        the 7th and projected 8th Central Pay Commission (CPC). The app provides:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>7th CPC salary calculator</li>
        <li>Projected 8th CPC salary calculator</li>
        <li>Comparison between 7th CPC and 8th CPC salary</li>
        <li>DA (Dearness Allowance) history and related statistics</li>
        <li>Guides on how salary is calculated</li>
        <li>News and updates related to pay commission (fetched from our backend)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The app is developed and maintained by an independent developer and is intended
        for informational and reference purposes only.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We <strong>do not</strong> require you to create an account or provide any personally
        identifiable information (such as your name, email address, phone number or Aadhaar).
      </p>
      <p>
        We also <strong>do not</strong> store your salary calculation inputs
        (like pay level, city, DA%, HRA options, etc.) on our servers.
        These values are used only on your device to perform the calculation.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Information Collected Automatically</h2>
      <p>
        The app itself does not actively track you. However, certain technical information
        may be collected automatically by third-party services used within the app or by the
        app store (Google Play). This may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device information (device model, OS version, language, etc.)</li>
        <li>App version and basic usage information</li>
        <li>Anonymous identifiers such as notification tokens</li>
        <li>Crash logs and performance data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is generally used to deliver notifications, improve app performance,
        fix bugs and understand general usage patterns. It is not used by us to personally
        identify you.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

      <h3>4.1 Supabase (Backend for News & Content)</h3>
      <p>
        We use <strong>Supabase</strong> as a backend service to store and deliver
        pay commission news and related content to the app.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supabase stores only the content that we create (news, guides, etc.).</li>
        <li>Your salary calculation inputs are <strong>not</strong> sent to Supabase.</li>
        <li>Supabase may log technical information such as IP address, request time and
          basic device details for security and analytics purposes, as per their own policies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.2 OneSignal (Push Notifications)</h3>
      <p>
        We use <strong>OneSignal</strong> to send push notifications, for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>New or updated pay commission news</li>
        <li>Important DA updates or salary-related information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For this purpose, OneSignal may collect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A device or notification token used to deliver messages</li>
        <li>Basic device and app information (such as app version, language, OS)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not use this information to personally identify you. You can disable push
        notifications at any time from your device settings or within the app (if such
        an option is offered).
      </p>

      <h3>4.3 Google Play Services and Other Libraries</h3>
      <p>
        The app may use standard Android/Google Play services and libraries which can collect
        anonymous usage data and diagnostics in accordance with
        Google’s own policies. This is handled by Google and not directly by us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please review the privacy policies of these services for more details. Their data
        collection and processing are governed by their own terms.
      </p>

      <h2>5. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>Any information we or our service providers collect is used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deliver app features and content (news, guides, calculators)</li>
        <li>Send relevant notifications about pay commission and DA updates</li>
        <li>Monitor app stability, performance and crashes</li>
        <li>Improve the app experience and plan future updates</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent or trade your personal information to any third party.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Since we do not store your personal salary inputs, there is no retention of those values
        on our servers. Any technical or log data collected by third-party services such as
        Supabase or OneSignal is retained according to their own retention policies.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect the limited information we handle, including using
        secure connections (HTTPS) when communicating with our backend services.
        However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and therefore we
        cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        This app is intended primarily for adults employed under government or related
        pay structures. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children
        under the age of 13. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal
        information, please contact us so that we can delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Disclaimer – Not an Official Government App</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>8th Pay Calculator</strong> is an independent calculator and information tool.
        It is <strong>not</strong> an official app of the Government of India, any ministry,
        department or commission.
      </p>
      <p>
        All calculations, projections (including 8th CPC estimates) and DA histories
        are provided for <strong>reference and educational purposes only</strong>.
        Actual salary, allowances and benefits are subject to official government rules,
        notifications and orders. Users should always verify their final salary and
        entitlements with official sources or their department.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app
        or in legal requirements. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the
        top of this page. Your continued use of the app after any changes means you accept
        the updated policy.
      </p>
